                <blockquote>
                    "I would like to clarify that I've never had upholstery cleaning done before, and it turned out to be one of those things that I will now do regularly or when needed, especially from these guys. I had a chair that has had a rough few years with pet stains and what not, love it to pieces and wouldn't part with it. Instead of paying a crazy amount to have it re-upholstered I had it cleaned. We decided to have our dining room chairs cleaned as well. They showed up on time, were quick, professional, attentive both prior to appointment set up and during cleaning, and overall were a pleasure to work with. Everything they cleaned looks and smells amazing. Highly recommended!"

They were able to get out spaghetti sauce stains and melting pot wax!! And old stains from puppy accidents (that resolve Carpet cleaner didn’t)!!!"
